## Introduction
> KWIC (Key Word In Context) index system provides a search mechanism for information in a long list of lines, such as book titles. The system accepts an ordered set of lines, each line is an ordered set of word, and each word is an ordered set of characters. For each input line, it shall be "circularly shifted" exhaustively by removing the first word and appending it at the end of the line to create a set of circularly shifted lines. The KWIC index system shall output on the screen a listing of the circularly shifted lines for all input lines in ascending alphabetical order.
